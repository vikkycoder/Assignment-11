    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the capability of running multiple processes simultaneously to execute tasks in parallel. It allows the utilization of multiple CPU cores or processors to execute code concurrently, thereby improving performance and taking advantage of available hardware resources.\n",

    "1.Improved Performance: By utilizing multiple processes, multiprocessing enables parallel execution of tasks. This can significantly improve performance, especially for computationally intensive or I/O-bound tasks, as the workload is distributed among multiple processors.\n",
